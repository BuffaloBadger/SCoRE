# Numerical Solution of IVODEs {.ct}

The design equations for some of the reactors considered in SCoRE are initial-value ordinary differential equations, or IVODEs, for short. This computational methods page will show you how to solve IVODEs numerically.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this computational methods appendix you should be able to...

1. Identify a set of IVODEs,
2. Know what you must provide to an IVODE solver and what it will return,
3. Specify initial values and a stopping criterion to pass to an IVODE solver,
4. Specify a derivatives function to pass to an IVODE solver,
5. Specify the algorithm steps for using an IVODE solver, and
6. Solve a set of IVODEs and display, save, or plot the results using Python or Matlab.
