# Solving IVODEs {.ct}

This lesson considers the numerical solution of initial value ordinary differential equations or IVODEs. It describes IVODE solvers and presents the [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"} utility function for solving IVODEs. It discusses the input that must be provided, and the results that are returned. It presents an overview of how IVODE solvers work and describes how to prepare to use them. Finally it demonstrates how to solve IVODEs using Python and Matlab.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this supplemental lesson you should...

1. Know what input must be provided to solve_ivodes.
2. Know what a derivatives function is, the input it requires and what it returns.
3. Understand why input must sometimes be made available to a derivatives function by means other than as an argument.
4. Be able to write specifications for the functions that are needed for solving IVODEs.
5. Be able to solve a set of IVODEs using Python or Matlab.
