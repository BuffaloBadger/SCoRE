## [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"} is not yet complete

Content is being added to [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"} in parallel with the revision of the first draft of *Reaction Engineering Basics.* I hope to complete both by the end of 2025.

:::

Eventually this page will contain a link to a welcome video. For now, however, I will be using it to log content as it is added to the site.
