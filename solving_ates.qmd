# Numerical Solution of ATEs {.ct}

Reaction engineering analyses sometimes require the solution of algebraic-transcendental equations, or ATEs, for short. This supplemental computational methods lesson will show you how to solve ATEs numerically.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this computational methods lesson you should...

1. Be able to identify a set of ATEs,
2. Know that when you call and ATE solver you must provide a guess for the ATE unknowns and a residuals function.
3. Know that when you write a residuals function the only argument must be a guess for the ATE unknowns and it must return only the corresponding values of the ATE residuals.
4. Know that an ATE solver may not converge to a solution.
5. Know that ATEs can have more than one solution, but if it converges, an ATE solver will only return one solution.
6. Be able to use Python or Matlab to solve a set of ATEs.
