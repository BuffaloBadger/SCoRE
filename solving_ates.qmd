# Solving ATEs {.ct}

This lesson considers the numerical solution of algebraic-transcendental equations or ATEs. It describes ATE solvers, the input that must be provided to them, and the results they return. It presents an overview of how they work and describes how to prepare to use them. Finally it demonstrates how to solve ATEs using Python and Matlab.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this supplemental lesson you should...

1. Know what input must be provided to an ATE solver.
2. Know what a residuals function is, the input it requires and what it returns.
3. Understand why input must sometimes be made available to a residuals function by means other than as an argument.
4. Be able to write specifications for the functions that are needed for solving ATEs.
5. Be able to solve a set of ATEs using Python or Matlab.

## Preparation
