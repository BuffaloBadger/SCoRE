## *SCoRE* is not yet complete

I am still creating the content for SCoRE. I am making it available in this partially complete format because I use it in a course I teach. My plan is to first complete the preparation assignments. Then I will create the class videos. Finally I'll create the introductory content and take down this alert. I'll be adding to the Computational Methods in parallel with the other content.
