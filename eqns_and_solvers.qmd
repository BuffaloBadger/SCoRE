# Equations and Solvers {.ct} 

This lesson considers equations that will be solved numerically in [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"}. It categorizes the quantities that appear in equations, describes the different types of equations that will be encountered, defines two important equation formats, and introduces the software that is used to solve equations numerically. The information presented in this lesson is used every time equations are solved numerically in [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"}.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this supplemental lesson you should...

1. Be able to describe the categories of quantities that appear in equations.
2. Be able to identify a set of equations as either ATEs, IVODEs, BVODEs, or DAEs.
3. Be able to rewrite an ATE as an equivalent residual expression.
4. Be able to rewrite a set of ODEs as an equivalent set of derivative expressions.
5. Understand that the software being used places constraints on functions you must write to solve equations numerically.

## Preparation

* Read [Reaction Engineering Basics](https://buffalobadger.github.io/RE_Basics/), Appendices F.1 through F.4.
