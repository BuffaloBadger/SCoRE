In those curricula, the reaction engineering course is typically taken by students in their third or fourth year. They are typically expected to posess prerequisite knowledge from courses taken earlier in their curriculum. SCoRE assumes that its learners have similar prerequisite knowledge as described in the following video.\n Prerequisite Knowledge Video (forthcoming on YouTube)",

One of those links is for the free, online book that SCoRE is based on, “Reaction Engineering Basics.\nThe menu on the left side of each page serves as the Table of Contents. Items with the symbol, \\(\\gt\\), following them will reveal a sub-menu if you click on them. When you first navigate to a SCo[RE] page, the sub-menu that contains it will be open (i. e. followed by the symbol, \\(\\lor\\)) and all the other sub-menus will be closed. Items that are not followed by a symbol are links to a single page.\nFinally, the menu on the right side of each page provides links to the sub-sections of the page you are viewing.",

Unfortunately, complete replication of the in-person course isn’t possible, necessitating some adaptation. The following video suggests a learning strategy for using SCoRE, suggesting adaptations for aspects of the in-person course that can not be replicated.\n\n Suggested Learning Strategy Video (forthcoming on YouTube)",
