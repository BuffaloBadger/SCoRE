# Class 5 {.ct}

## Rate-Determining Steps {.ch}

Class 5 defines rate-determining step and introduces quasi-equilibrium. Their use in eliminating concentrations of reactive intermediates from mechanistic rate expressions is described and illustrated.

## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 5 you should...

1. know that a rate-determining step is a kinetic bottleneck, but it is not the slowest step in a mechanism
2. know that the free energy change for a rate-determining step is nearly equal to the free energy change for the associated non-elementary reaction
3. know that if there is a rate-determining step, all other steps are quasi-equilibrated
4. know how to use rate-determining and quasi-equilibrated steps to eliminate concentrations of reactive intermediates from mechanistic rate expressions
