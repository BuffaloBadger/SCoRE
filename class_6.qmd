# Class 6 {.ct}

## Catalyst and Charge Conservation {.ch}

Class 6 describes enzymes, homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts. It explains that when a mechanism involves enzymes, catalysts, or charged reagents, a conservation equation applies to the concentrations of the intermediates, and show how such equations are used when generating mechanistic rate expressions.

## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 6 you should...

1. be able to define enzymes, homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts, and surface coverage
2. be able to explain why catalyst complexes, enzyme complexes, charged reagents, and surface species are treated like reactive intermediates when generating mechanistic rate expressions
3. be able to write equations for the conservation of catalyst, enzyme, charge, or surface sites and use them when generating mechanistic rate expressions
4. know that an equation for the conservation of catalyst, enzyme, charge, or surface sites reduces the number of mathematically independent Bodenstein steady state approximation equations by one
