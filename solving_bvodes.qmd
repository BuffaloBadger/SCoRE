# Solving BVODEs {.ct}

This lesson considers the numerical solution of boundary value ordinary differential equations or BVODEs. It describes BVODE solvers, the input that must be provided to them, and the results they return. It presents an overview of how they work and describes how to prepare to use them. Finally it demonstrates how to solve BVODEs using Python and Matlab.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this supplemental lesson you should...

1. Know what input must be provided to a BVODE solver.
2. Know what a derivatives function is, the input it requires and what it returns.
3. Know what a boundary conditions residuals function is, the input it requires and what it returns.
4 Be able to write specifications for the functions that are needed for solving BVODEs.
5. Be able to solve a set of BVODEs using Python or Matlab.

## Preparation

* Read [Reaction Engineering Basics](https://buffalobadger.github.io/RE_Basics/), Appendices F.3.3 and F.5.4.
