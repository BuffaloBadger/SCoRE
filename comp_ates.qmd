# Numerical Solution of ATEs {.ct}

The design equations for some of the reactors considered in SCoRE are algebraic-transcendental equations, or ATEs, for short. This computational methods lesson will show you how to solve ATEs numerically.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this computational methods lesson you should be able to...

1. Identify a set of ATEs,
2. Know what you must provide to an ATE solver and what it will return,
3. Specify an initial guess to pass to an ATE solver,
4. Write specifications for a residuals function that will be passed to an ATE solver,
5. Write specifications for a reactor (or other equipment) function that will solve its ATE design equations by calling an ATE solver, and
6. Solve a set of ATEs and display and save the results using Python or Matlab.
