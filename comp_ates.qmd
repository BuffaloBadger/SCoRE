# Numerical Solution of ATEs {.ct}

The design equations for some of the reactors considered in SCoRE are algebraic-transcendental equations, or ATEs, for short. This computational methods page will show you how to solve ATEs numerically.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this computational methods appendix you should be able to...

1. Identify a set of ATEs,
2. Know what you must provide to an ATE solver and what it will return,
3. Specify an initial guess to pass to an ATE solver,
4. Specify a residuals function to pass to an ATE solver,
5. Specify the algorithm steps for using an ATE solver, and
6. Solve a set of ATEs and display, save, or plot the results using Python or Matlab.
