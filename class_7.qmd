# Class 7 {.ct}

## Most Abundant Intermediate {.ch}

Class 7 examines the situation where one of the intermediates in a catalytic reaction mechanism is present in much greater concentration that all other intermediates. It shows how the existence of a most abundant intermediate can sometime allow simplification of a mechanistic rate expression.

## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 7 you should...

1. be able to define a most abundant intermediate
2. know how to try to simplify mechanistic rate expressions for catalytic reactions where there is a most abundant intermediate
