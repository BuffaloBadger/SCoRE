This is a repository for the SCoRE website.

SCoRE stands for Self-study Course on Reaction Engineering.

It ties together a collection of videos and documents, organizing them in a course-like structure.

The .pdf, .m, .py, and .csv files are generated elsewhere and copied into the code, data, or documents folders, as appropriate.

Videos are not stored as part of the site; they are provided through links to YouTube. The YouTube videos are created elsewhere.

The SCoRE logo incorporates clip art from Creazilla.com.
