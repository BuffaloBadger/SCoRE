# Repository for the SCoRE website.

SCoRE (Self-study Course on Reaction Engineering) will be a collection of links to YouTube videos, .pdf documents, and code (Matlab and Pytnon). It will be tightly integrated with Reaction Engineering Basics. The website organizes this content in a course-like structure.
