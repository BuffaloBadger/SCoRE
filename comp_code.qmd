# SCoRE Computer Code {.ct}

For any SCoRE example, activity or assignment that requires computer calculations, a single master file is created to perform the calculations. This supplemental computational methods lesson describes the programming conventions and code structure that are used in SCoRE master files.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Understand that the calculations for each example, learning activity, and practice assignment presented in SCoRE the calculations are performed in a single python script or in a single Matlab function.
2. Understand the code in the following primary sections of a SCoRE master script/function and be able to describe its purpose:
    a. Global Constants Section
    b. Global Variables Section
    c. Reactor Model Section
    d. Other Models Section
    e. Quantities of Interest Section
    f. Execution Statement
