# Computer Code {.ct} 

This lesson discusses coding practices that are employed when writing computer code in [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"}. It then describes the code structure used in the master file for each example included in [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"}. The information presented in this lesson is encountered in every [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"} class where equations are solved using either Matlab or Python.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this supplemental lesson you should...

1. Understand that the execution speed and size of computer code presented in [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"} could often be improved because it is written to be easy to understand.
2. Appreciate the difference between global constants and global variables as implemented in [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"} code.
3. Be able to use global variables to make quantities available to a function when they cannot be passed to it as arguments.
4. Understand the code structure used in [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"} and realize that you can structure your code differently if you wish.

## Preparation
