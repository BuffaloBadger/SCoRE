# Computational Methods {.ct} 

The lessons in this supplemental part of [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"} show how to solve different kinds of equations using either Python or Matlab. The first lesson describes describes the programming conventions and code structure that are used in [SC]{style="color:blue"}o[RE]{style="color:red"}. The remaining lessons describe solving algebraic-transcendental equations (ATEs), solving initial-value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs), solving coupled-value ordinary differential equations (CVODEs), estimating model parmeters using experimental data, and solving boundary-value ordinary differential equations (BVODEs).
