# Class 4 {.ct}

## Reaction Mechanisms {.ch}

Class 4 introduces reaction mechanisms and mechanistic rate expressions. It describes how reaction mechanisms can be used to generate rate expressions and explains the Bodenstein steady-state approximation.

## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 4 you should...

1. be able to describe what a reaction mechanism is
2. know the different kinds of steps in a chain reaction mechanism
3. be able to identify reactive intermediates in a reaction mechanism
4. be able to write the rate expression for a mechanistic step
5. know how to write an expression for the rate of generation of a reactant or product in a non-elementary reaction in terms of the rates of the steps in the reaction mechanism 
6. know how to simplify the rate expressions for mechanistic steps that are kinetically insignificant or effectively irreversible
7. know how to use the Bodenstein steady-state approximation to eliminate concentrations of reactive intermediates from a mechanistic rate expression
