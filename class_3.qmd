# Class 3 {.ct}

## Rates and Rate Expressions {.ch}

Class 3 defines the rate of reaction and rate expressions. It discusses the mathematical form of rate expressions and the ways they can be developed.

## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 3 you should...

1. know the definitions of and relationship between the general rate of reaction and the rate of generation of a reagent
2. know what a rate expression is and how a rate expression is validated
3. be able to use the Arrhenius expression for a rate coefficient
4. be able to explain the difference between theoretical, empirical, and mechanistic rate expressions
5. know the mathematical form of a theoretical rate expression
