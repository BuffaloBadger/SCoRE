# Numerical Solution of CVODEs {.ct}

The design equations for some of the reactors considered in SCoRE are coupled-value ordinary differential equations, or CVODEs, for short. This computational methods page will show you how to solve CVODEs numerically.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this computational methods appendix you should be able to...

1. Identify a set of CVODEs,
2. Know what you must provide to a CVODE solver and what it will return,
3. Specify...,
5. Specify the algorithm steps for using a CVODE solver, and
6. Solve a set of CVODEs and display, save, or plot the results using Python or Matlab.
