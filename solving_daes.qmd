# Solving DAEs {.ct}

This lesson considers the numerical solution of differential-algebraic equations, or DAEs. It describes how to formulate the calculations so that the DAEs can be solved using an ATE solver and an IVODE solver. It also demonstrates how to solve DAEs using Python and Matlab.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this supplemental lesson you should...

1. Be able to write an implicit equation that relates an unknown constant or initial value in a set of IVODEs to a known final value.
2. Be able to write specifications for the functions that are needed for solving DAEs.
3. Be able to solve a set of DAEs using Python or Matlab.

## Preparation

* Read [Reaction Engineering Basics](https://buffalobadger.github.io/RE_Basics/), Appendices F.3.2 and F.5.3.
