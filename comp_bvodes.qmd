# Numerical Solution of BVODEs {.ct}

The design equations for some of the reactors considered in SCoRE are boundary-value ordinary differential equations, or BVODEs, for short. This computational methods page will show you how to solve BVODEs numerically.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this computational methods appendix you should be able to...

1. Identify a set of BVODEs,
2. Know what you must provide to a BVODE solver and what it will return,
3. Specify a derivatives function to pass to a BVODE solver,
4. Specify a boundary conditions residuals function to pass to a BVODE solver,
5. Specify the algorithm steps for using a BVODE solver, and
6. Solve a set of BVODEs and display, save, or plot the results using Python or Matlab.
